# nvim/lab

Self-contained nvim config test cases.

It's easy to get lost in a very large init.lua and become unsure which
behaviour correlates to which code. This directory creates a space in which to
experiment with small single-purpose configurations. The idea is to facilitate
isolating individual problems and their solutions without the background noise
of a fully-fledged personal config.
