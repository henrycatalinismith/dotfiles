# prettier format-on-save with conform.nvim

Automatically running prettier on save is a must-have in certain projects and
always feels a little bit fiddly to set up so I want a nice self-contained place
where I can look at it in isolation

## Usage

```
npm i
nvim -u init.lua example.js
```

## Output
